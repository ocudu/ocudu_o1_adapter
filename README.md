# OCUDU O1 Adapter

## Overview

Python application acting as adapter between CU/DU towards the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO).
The application currently supports:
* Configuration Management (CM),
* Fault Management (FM).

Performance Managment (PM) is currently implemented through a Json-based metrics service exposed over the
Websocket interface of OCUDU.

In a Kubernetes deployment the O1-Adapter is supposed to be running as a sidecar container next to the e.g.
OCUDU DU container to control the config file generation/provisioning and livecycle of the Pod through a shared volume and REST-based API, respectively.

## Installation

Using `requirements.txt` or on Ubuntu with `sudo apt-get install python3-ncclient python3-flask python3-xmltodict`

Within a python virtual environment, install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Operation

Upon start the application attempts to connect to a Config datastore over SSH/netconf. If it succeeds an initial configuration file will be genereated using the `running` datastore.

## Manual Execution

Make sure a Netconf server is running an can be reached over `localhost` on port `830` (those defaults can be changed over the command line). Run the app in one console:

`$ python3 src/o1_adapter`

The application will listen on all available network interfaces including `localhost`.

In another console use `curl` to check the config healthiness:

`$ curl -i http://localhost:5000/config-healthy`

It should report the config to be healthy.

Make a config modifcation to the `running` datastore and rerun the command. It should now report `Error code 400` config unhealthy. This status can be used to trigger a restart of the DU container application.

To reset the health status send the following command to the server:

`$ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "restarted": True}' -X POST http://localhost:5000/restarted`

An example Docker and k8s integration is provided.

## RU controller

The RU controller is (currently) a stand-alone application to configure an O-RU over Mplane.
Taking an example RU that exposes it's Netconf interface over `10.10.0.100` using `admin/admin` as login credentials for example, we can retrieve the current RU config with:

```
$ ./ru_controller.py --host=10.10.0.100 -u admin -p admin -d running --get_config
```

We can activate the carrier with:

```
$ ./ru_controller.py --host=10.10.0.100 -u admin -p admin -d running --tx_gain=26.0 --activate_carriers --carrier_state ACTIVE
```

Run a full RU configuration with:

```
$ ./ru_controller.py --host=10.10.0.100 -u admin -p admin -d running --set_full_config --ru_mac_addr=00:a0:0a:01:a4:42 --vlan=127 --du_mac_addr=9c:69:b4:66:cd:48 --iq_bitwidth=9  --compression_type=STATIC --rf_bandwidth_hz=100000000 --dl_arfcn=649980 --dl_freq=3749700000 --tx_gain=39 --ul_arfcn=649980 --ul_freq=3749700000 --carrier_state ACTIVE
```

Note: Full configuration has only been verified for a subset of configuration, e.g. with TDD 100MHz, PRACH format B4.
